        <p class="head">Your blood sugar is high.</p>

        <p>If your blood sugar is below 180, this is an acceptable level 1-2 hours after a meal. If your blood sugar is in this range more than 2 hours after a meal, it needs to be lowered.</p>

        <p>Take fast-acting insulin: talk to a doctor for dosage levels. Monitor your blood sugar 30 minutes after to ensure it is not too low.</p>

        <p>Exercise: Physical activity will cause your body to use more glucose for energy.</p>
